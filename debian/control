Description: Specialized passphrase recovery tool for GnuPG
 If you can nearly remember your GnuPG passphrase - but not quite - then
 Rephrase may be able to help. Tell Rephrase the parts of the passphrase you
 know, and any number of alternatives for the parts you're not sure about; and
 Rephrase will try all the alternatives, in all possible combinations, and tell
 you which combination (if any) gives you the correct passphrase.
